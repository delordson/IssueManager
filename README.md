The Issue Manager App is a tool for capturing, tracking and responding to Issues as they arise in your Organisation. The Issue Manager App allows organisation to capture issues, assign and Issue Owner, task and employee with resolving the Issue and record corrective and preventative action.

This is a fully featured complete LightSwitch html5 line of business application which you can extend and adapt to your specific needs.

&nbsp;
<h2>Modules</h2>
The Issue Manager App Home Page provides easy access the primary modules which include the Issues Module,  the My Issues Module, the My Training Further Actions Module, the Employees module and the Issue Types Module. In addition, the Home page presents some key stats about the status of Issues recorded in the application.

<h2>Issues</h2>
Clicking or tabbing on the Issues button takes the user to the ‘Browse Issues’ Page. On this page, the user of presented with a list of all Issues. A search box is present for quickly navigating to a required Issue.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/IssueManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11162013_125355.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1570" title="screenshot_11162013_125355" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/IssueManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11162013_125355.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on any Issue listed takes the user to a page for managing that Issue. This page provides for full details of the Issue including status.

The page is laid out in a series of tabs. The first tab presents key information about the Issues such as its date raised, title, description, owner, who it is assigned to, status and target resolution date.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/IssueManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11162013_125401.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1571" title="screenshot_11162013_125401" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/IssueManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11162013_125401.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Employees are automatically emailed when they are assigned a new Issue to resolve.

&nbsp;

Of course the built in LightSwitch validation of required fields and field lengths works great as expected…

…but we’ve also added business logic where it makes sense. So you can’t add set the target date to be earlier than the date raised.
